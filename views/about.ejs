    <h4 class="pt-4">What is Tijdkaart?</h4>
    <p>Tijdkaart is a translation from Dutch to English to "Time card".</p>
    <h4 class="pt-4">Explanation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This time card calculator was originally created for personal use but, with a database behind it and a secure enough login system, I decided to put it online, for all of
        the 5 users that are going to end up looking at my site ðŸ˜‡
      </li>
      <li>
        The "Home" page is showing the table for the current month we're in, here you can press the "Add Shift" button and a modal would pop up for you to enter the timerange of
        that specific shift, and if you want - a comment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon adding a shift, you would be able to see a quick glance of the current month - total hours, total shifts, and total earned. You can obviously edit what you've added.
      </li>
      <li>In the "History" page you could find your past logged shifts.</li>
      <li>I'll leave the rest for you to figure out ðŸ˜€</li>
    </ul>
